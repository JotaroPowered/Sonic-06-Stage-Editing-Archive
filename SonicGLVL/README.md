This folder contains the Templates and Object Definition file for GLVL that are used for constructing SETs and in the GLVL Conversion process. Copy the Database folder from here to your copy of SonicGLVL and replace the existing files.

If you also use GLVL for Generations stage modding, then you may want to make a copy/download a fresh copy of it from the LibGens GitHub page.

The #base.ar.00 and #base.arl files are Sonic Generations stage archives that are delibertely designed to be empty (minus a blank SET file and Green Hill's scene parameters), these can be used as a template for injecting your terrain into using HedgehogConverter, be sure to set the import scale for your '06 terrain to 1%, or the stage will not appear correctly in GLVL.
