This folder contains the Templates and Object Definition file for GLVL that are used for constructing SETs and in the GLVL Conversion process. Copy the Database folder from here to your copy of SonicGLVL and replace the existing files.

If you also use GLVL for Generations stage modding, then you may want to make a copy/download a fresh copy of it from the LibGens GitHub page.
